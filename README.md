# shr â”‚ [![Build Status](https://github.com/haqa-ru/shr/actions/workflows/actions.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/haqa-ru/shr/actions/workflows/actions.yml)

Instant sharing utility web interface designed for *programmatic* or *manual* use.

curl -T ./example.txt https://shr.haqa.ru/api/share/example.txt
